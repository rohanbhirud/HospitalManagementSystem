## Overview

The backend of the Hospital Management System is responsible for managing and processing data related to the day-to-day activities of the hospital. It provides APIs for the frontend to interact with, and handles tasks such as user authentication, patient record management, and appointment scheduling.

## Structure

The backend is structured as follows:

- `src`: This directory contains the source code of the backend. It includes models, controllers, routes, and utilities.
- `tests`: This directory contains test files for the backend.

## Dependencies

The backend uses the following libraries and frameworks:

- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the APIs.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to manage relationships between data and provides schema validation.
- Jest: A JavaScript testing framework, used to write tests for the backend.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for the backend, navigate to the `app-backend` directory and run the following command:

```
npm test
